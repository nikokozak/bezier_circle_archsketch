![Sketch Pic](bezierCicle.png)

A rough vanilla JS and Canvas (2d) sketch for generating random bezier-based circular configurations. Used as a shapefinding tool. Play with the different values for different results. You can pause and resume the simulation to better look at the generated shapes.

To run (naive):
1. Open index.html in a web browser of your choice.
